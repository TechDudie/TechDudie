Hello! I don't know what the ████ I'm doing. But, that's okay.

I'm busy crashing out at:
- 🏫 my high school (if a prison warden was a bureaucratic entity)
- 🛠️ C/C++ (cruel and unusual punishment)
- ⚙️ Rust (but it restores my faith in humanity)
- 🐍 pytorch (to appease the future AI overlords)

I'm working on a fun Rust toy that does cool academic things because chaos is a result, never a cause.<br>
Soon-to-be frustrated sysadmin.
